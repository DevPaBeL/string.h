# The string.h library
In this project, the functions of the standard string.h library were developed, a Makefile was developed, and unit tests and a gcov report were done.  
To run the tests, we prescribe the command: make test  
In order to see the test coverage of the code, the command is: make gcov_report  
For cleaning: make clean.
